# ExamClock
A GUI Windows application developed in Python to facilitate exam administration at CLIP - The Oporto International School. This application was distributed across all computers at the school and is currently used to administer exams.

ExamClock allows those administering exams to easily display the time for several exams, as well as automatically calculating the end time and extra time for specific students, without the need of manual intervention.

The feedback received for ExamClock has been overwhelmingly positive, as it has empowered users throughout the school to set up exams with ease and in a much shorter time frame.
